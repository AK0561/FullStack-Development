## Installation

To install Node.js, you can download the installer for your operating system from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js also comes with npm (Node Package Manager) pre-installed, which allows you to easily manage JavaScript packages and libraries.

## Features

- **Server-side JavaScript**: Node.js enables you to run JavaScript on the server, allowing for the development of web applications, APIs, and more using a single language.

- **Asynchronous and Non-blocking**: Node.js is designed to handle I/O operations asynchronously, making it highly efficient for tasks like file I/O and network operations.

- **V8 JavaScript Engine**: Node.js is powered by the V8 JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google and provides high-performance execution of JavaScript code.

- **NPM**: Node.js includes npm, a package manager that makes it easy to install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries and modules.

- **Event-driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for real-time applications like chat servers and online gaming.

- **Large Ecosystem**: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries available through npm, covering a wide range of use cases.
