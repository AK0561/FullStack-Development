- **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters to handle large workloads.

- **High Performance**: MongoDB's native drivers and indexing capabilities ensure high query performance, making it suitable for real-time applications.

- **Rich Query Language**: MongoDB supports a rich query language with support for filtering, sorting, aggregation, and geospatial queries.

- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's schema-less design allows you to evolve your data model as your application requirements change.

- **Replication and Sharding**: MongoDB supports automatic data replication and sharding to ensure data availability and reliability.

- **Security**: MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.

## Getting Started

Getting started with MongoDB is easy. After installation, you can start a MongoDB server and connect to it using the MongoDB shell. Here's a basic example:

1. Start MongoDB:

```bash
mongod
```

2. Open a new terminal and connect to the MongoDB server:

```bash
mongosh
```

3. You're now in the MongoDB shell. You can start working with databases, collections, and documents using JavaScript-like commands.
